## Exploratory Data Analysis

This will be workshop content for exploratory data analysis. The
inspiration is the following:

Staniak & Biecek (2019). The Landscape of R Packages for Automated
Exploratory Data Analysis. R Journal.

I was curious about some of these tools for my own use and thought Iâ€™d
make a workshop out of it. The workshop itself will mostly be demo,
allowing the participants to run the code alongside me.
