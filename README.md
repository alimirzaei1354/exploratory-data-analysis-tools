## Exploratory Data Analysis

This is workshop content for exploratory data analysis. The inspiration
is the following:

Staniak & Biecek (2019). The Landscape of R Packages for Automated
Exploratory Data Analysis. R Journal.
([link](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2019/RJ-2019-033/index.html))

I was curious about some of these tools for my own use and thought Iâ€™d
make a workshop out of it. The workshop itself will mostly be demo,
allowing the participants to run the code alongside me.
