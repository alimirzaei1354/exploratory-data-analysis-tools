# Introduction

In R there  are a lot of tools out there for exploring data.  However, in consulting I still most people using base R's table and summary functions, followed by a lot of work to get the result in a more presentable format.  My own frustrations led to me creating a mini package ([tidyext](https://m-clark.github.io/tidyext/)) for personal use in this area.  While that suits me fine, there are tools that can go much further with little effort. Recently, Staniak & Biecek @staniak2019landscape wrote an article in the R Journal exploring several of such packages, so I thought I'd try them out for myself, and take others along with me for that ride.
