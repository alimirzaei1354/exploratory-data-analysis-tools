# Exploratory Data Analysis

This will be workshop content for exploratory data analysis.  The inspiration is the following:

Staniak & Biecek (2019). The Landscape of R Packages for Automated Exploratory Data Analysis. R Journal.


I was curious about some of these tools for my own use and thought I'd make a workshop out of it.  The workshop itself will mostly be demo, allowing the participants to run the code alongside me.
